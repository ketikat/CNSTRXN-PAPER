# D-Construction

D-Construction developed around the letter "D".  I was interested in making my own “typekit” that resembled a crude cut-out construction paper project.  The letter “D” serves as the base or smallest unit of the alphabet. All of the letters in the alphabet are constructed from various “D” shapes; hence the title “D-Construction”.

This is a project that relies heavily on SVG’s and uses React & Redux to render everything on the page responsively. I tried to minimize the use of CSS, and only the animation relies on it.

The final result is a very basic app that you can use to generate custom SVG’s based on my typekit.
